# AI Powereed Lung Cancer Nodule Detection and Classification (Predictive Medical Imaging Software)
This initally started as my disseration project in university where the main goal was to use machine learning techniques to help accelerate the diagnosis process of lung cancer, aiming to help detect lung cancer at early stages to be put on cancer treatments as soon as possible.
## Overview
This is a software solution, meaning it can be divided into 2 parts: Software and Machine Learning. The software element includes the UI, image pre-processing etc. While the machine learning element is a pre-trained model from a large dataset that was originally developed using Kaggle and their Jupter notebook. The most important part of this project is the Machine Learning model as the software is more for functionality, interface, a product that is used with the machine learning model.
### History
As mentioned before, this was my disseration in 3rd year of university and at the deadline this part of the disseration (the code and software) was unfinished, however this didn't cause me to fail because I spent most of my time coding the machine learning model that is separate and was mostly graded off of that as well as the writing element of my disseration but I felt unsatisfied personally about the unfinished project, and wanted to have something to show to people at the end so I decided to take up the challenge once more and finish this project not only for myself but to add to my portfolio.
### Aim
The aim of this application is to analyse CT-scans of a patient's lungs and provide a prediction of whether there is malignant or benign lung cancer present, using the UI to visually show where in the CT-Scan lung cancer could be as well as the classification predicted.
